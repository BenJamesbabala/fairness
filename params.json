  "body": "### Overview\r\n\r\nMachine learning has taken over our world, in more ways than we realize. You might get book recommendations, or an efficient route to your destination, or even a winning strategy for a game of Go. But you might also be admitted to college, granted a loan, or hired for a job based on algorithmically enhanced decision-making. We believe machines are neutral arbiters: cold, calculating entities that always make the right decision, that can see patterns that our human minds can’t or won’t. But are they? Or is decision-making-by-algorithm a way to amplify, extend and make inscrutable the biases and discrimination that is prevalent in society?\r\n\r\nTo answer these questions, we need to go back — all the way to the original ideas of justice and fairness in society. We also need to go forward — towards a mathematical framework for talking about justice and fairness in machine learning. I will talk about the growing landscape of research in algorithmic fairness: how we can reason systematically about biases in algorithms, and how we can make our algorithms fair(er).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Syllabus\r\n---\r\n* Dec 11: **Preliminaries**\r\n\r\n    Basics of machine learning -- supervised and unsupervised learning, empirical risk minimization, classifiers, regression, training and generalization. \r\n\r\n    *Readings*:\r\n    * Chapters 1 [(PDF)](http://ciml.info/dl/v0_9/ciml-v0_9-ch01.pdf), 3.1-3.4 [(PDF)](http://ciml.info/dl/v0_9/ciml-v0_9-ch03.pdf) and 4 [(PDF)](http://ciml.info/dl/v0_9/ciml-v0_9-ch04.pdf) of Hal Daumé's [excellent book on ML](http://ciml.info). \r\n    * Hal's [post on the ML development pipeline](http://nlpers.blogspot.com/2016/08/debugging-machine-learning.html). This is framed in terms of the way errors can creep into the modeling process, but it doubles as an excellent explanation of the pipeline itself. \r\n* Dec 12: **Automated Decision Making**\r\n\r\n    Case studies of the use of machine learning in applications. An introduction to different formal notions of fairness.\r\n* Dec 13: **Fairness Mechanisms I**\r\n\r\n    Understanding the different techniques for ensuring fairness in classification.\r\n* Dec 14: **Fairness Mechanisms II**\r\n\r\n    Continued...\r\n* Dec 15: **Belief Systems**\r\n\r\n    Axiomatic foundations of fairness and justice. Rawls and beyond.\r\n* Dec 16: **Accountability**\r\n\r\n    Probing black-box decision-makers: estimating influence of features.\r\n* Dec 17: **Interpretability\r\n\r\n    Building interpretable models.\r\n* Dec 18: **Fairness, Accountability and Transparency in other areas of comuter science**\r\n\r\n    Beyond classification: unsupervised learning and representations\r\n* Dec 19: **The Broader View**\r\n\r\n    The influence of algorithmic decision-making in the law and policy. \r\n* Dec 20\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nEmail me at [suresh@cs.utah.edu](mailto:suresh@cs.utah.edu)",
