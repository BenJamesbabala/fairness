# Introduction

In the last lecture, we reviewed the use of machine learning in a number of "fairness-critical" environments and talked about definitions of nondiscrimination and fairness that have been proposed over the years. In this lecture, we'll look at *mechanisms* for achieving the desired goals: how can we build systems that will be fair and unbiased in the different ways we've defined so far. 

Not surprisingly, different definitions will call for different solutions, and we'll have to discuss them separately. There are three broad classes of techniques that apply independently of the measure chosen and we'll organize our exploration around these three ideas.
