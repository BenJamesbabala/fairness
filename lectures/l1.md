# Automated Decision Making

While it would be hard to find any part of our daily lives that are *not* touched by machine learning, the issues of fairness and accountability really come into play when we think about algorithms that make *decisions* (or assist with them).

So if we think of the classic binary classification problem where the goal is to determine a mapping $f $ from the input $X$ to the set $\{-1, 1\}$, we should instead think of a mapping into the *decision space* $\{Y, N\}$. More generally, the mapping might not actually return a binary variable. Rather, it might return some kind of "risk score" that we can interpret as a probability of $Y$. Or it might return a number that we will later threshold: for example the FICO score is a number whose maximum value is 850: a score of 700 or higher is deemed quite good.

This decision could be anything: it could be the decision to place an ad on a web page, or the decision to make a recommendation to an user from a shopping website, or a recommendation for a route to take when asked for directions. It could even be the decision about *what* to return in a search query,

Decisions can be more complex: for example, the decision of how to rank results on a search query doesn't quite fit the model above. It can be modeled approximately by assuming that the decision task is to assign  a rank to a search result. But for the purpose of discussion we'll stick to the binary output model (or in some cases its regression cousin).

What I'd like to do is explore a few cases in some detail to understand *how* the automated decision-making pipeline works. In some cases, the very fact that algorithms are being used might be considered surprising (or shocking!). But for any examination of the benefits (and dangers) of using automated methods to be thorough, we should walk through the different domains.

These examples are (unfortunately) very specific to the US context: both in terms of what's currently going on and in terms of what the law allows. But I'd encourage you all to think about how these might (or do) apply in the context of Indian law as well.

## Criminal Justice

Let's start with the most consequential example of the use of automated methods: in the criminal justice system. There is an entire pipeline of decisions that start with the question of how the police target areas (and individuals) for investigation and end with decisions about whether to release someone from jail on parole or not. This are usually described by two processes:

1. predictive policing
2. risk assessment

### Predictive policing

You've probably seen the scifi movie Minority Report which describes a near future where telepathically enhanced individuals "predict" crime before it happens. While predictive policing doesn't claim to go this far, it is an attempt to use prior crime history to predict crime in two ways:

* **where** crime is likely to happen
* **who** might be committing a crime.

For the rest of this, we will discuss only the first kind of predictive model. It is being used widely across police departments. The second model is of uncertain legality and appears to be the domain of national intelligence services for the most part.

The goal of spatial predictive policing is to determine where crime might be more likely to occur. The point of doing this is to manage the scarce resources of a police department: patrol officers, cars, and so on. If a department "knows" that a certain region of a precinct will be a crime "hotspot" that day, they can provision more officers to that area while patrolling less risky areas less frequently.

For this purpose, a region of space is often subdivided into *cells* â€” say a few blocks across. The predictive task here is then: over a fixed time period $t$ (say a day), for each cell $c$ of a collection of cells, assign a score $s(c, t)$ that is higher if $c$ is likely to experience more crime during period $t$. In its simplest form, the score $s(c, t)$ could merely be a binary-valued variable indicating crime ($1$) or no-crime ($0$).

In order to build this predictor, a learning algorithm might use a variety of data sources and features: these might include

* crime reports to the police in $c$ over "similar" time periods in the past.
* actual arrests made in $c$
* calls to emergency services (that may or may not result in an arrest or even a crime report)
* baseline demographic information in the cell.
* information about special events that might influence crime rates and reporting (for example, rioting in the streets after a sports event).

### Training data

In predictive policing, training data is typically historical records of crime in the area, possibly qualified by time of year/season (for example data from the summer is used to predict crime in the summer, and so on).

### Risk assessment

Risk assessment addresses the "other" side of criminal justice, after someone has been arrested for a crime. Risk assessment tools come into play at different stages of the conviction, sentencing and release pipeline: for example:

* should an undertrial be released on bail prior to the hearing
* what duration sentence should a convicted individual be given within the guidelines laid out by the law.
* should an inmate be granted parole or sent back to prison.

Notice that risk assessment, unlike the standard use of predictive policing, is individual-based. In each case, the "risk" being assessed here is whether the individual represents an unreasonable risk (of fleeing before trial, of receiving an undeservedly lenient sentence, of committing new crimes) if released into the general population. The risk assessment algorithm will take as input features associated with an individual $p$ and output a *risk score* $r(p)$ between $0$ and $1$ (or in some interval) where $1$ represents a high risk of danger if $p$ is released and $0$ represents no risk.

Since these decisions are made for an individual, the features used tend to be more specific, they might include:

* demographics information about the individual
* past history and nature of crimes
* social milieu and network.
* general psychological and emotional state.

For example, when an inmate comes up for parole, they are put through a battery of questions (135 in some cases) that span the range of topics mentioned above, and these are fed into a predictor to output a risk level between $1$ and $10$ of whether they'll recommit a crime within 6 months of release (or within 2 years).

The scores produced by risk assessment tools are typically not determinative: they are merely one feature provided to a judge to do with as they see fit. In fact, there are studies suggesting that the degree to which judges take risk assessments into consideration vary widely and inconsistently.

### Training data

In risk assessment, training data comes from prior records of bail violations, recidivism and so on. General demographics factors might also be used to condition the data (such as national or state averages of recidivism and so on)

## Hiring

For reasons of both scale (the number of applicants applying for jobs) and diversity (trying to ensure a broad representation of skills in the workforce), many companies are trying to go beyond the standard human-interview based model for hiring to take advantage of data analytics. The general goal is to predict which potential employees are likely to "do well" at their job. This can be interpreted in a variety of ways:

* likely to stay at the job for a sufficient period of time (*retention*)
* likely to have high productivity in the job (*productivity*)
* likely to be content at the job (*satisfaction*).

Note that the criteria don't necessarily measure the same attributes, an employee might be willing to stay at their job without being productive, and might be productive and yet unsatisfied.

The idea therefore is to use predictive tools as well as new techniques for processing applicants to make such an assessment. Formally, just as above, the predictive tool would assign a score $s(p)$ to an applicant $p$ and then present this score to the hiring manager as part of a dashboard of information.

What makes hiring interesting is the innovation that has taken place in *how* the interviews are conducted and analyzed. It is now common for an applicant to undergo a fully automated initial screening or full interview, without any human intervention. These interviews can be video or text-based. In either case, the applicant is sent to a website to login to at a time of their choosing, and then the interview proceeds.

* in a text-based interview, the applicant sees questions on the screen and has to type out their answers. The answers are typically timed, and while no attempt is made to prevent applicants from "looking up" answers, the questions are sufficiently open-ended as to preclude this within the time specified. Such a process might even occur for tech interviews where an applicant might be asked to write code or pseudo code.
* In a video-based interview, the applicant might either see questions from a pre-recorded video, or might again see text questions. In either case, the applicant records a video response (usually via their webcam), and this is sent off for further analysis.

Once the responses have been received, the predictive model goes to work. It extracts features from the transcript: these might be text features - words, phrases, and so on. These might also be cues from the video. Face recognition software is used to identify micro-expressions in the face while the interviewee responds, and these are tagged with "standard" interpretations (such as are used for example in lie-detection systems).

This entire list of features is assembled into the input to a predictor, which then returns the desired score.

### Training data

When a third party vendor works with a company to build a predictive model, they might build a custom model for that organization. Every company might have different hiring needs â€” a tech startup might be looking for different characteristics than a multinational hotel chain for example. A common way to acquire training data is therefore to look at past employee records to see how well they did, and build a predictive model from it.

## Loans

When a bank issues a loan, their primary concern is credit-worthiness: will the loanee pay back the loan promptly and in full? For centuries, lenders have used many different strategies to assess credit-worthiness, including factors like collateral (what items can be used as a risk mitigator in case of default), history of loan repayment, behavioral attributes (does this individual indulge in risky behavior) and even background cultural context.

In the US, loan granting was an area that was rife with racism and other forms of bias: indeed the term *redlining* comes from the racist mortgage lending practices of the 1930s. In the 60s, an attempt to reform this process led to the development of what is now known as the FICO score: it ranges from 0-850 with a higher score indicating a more trustworthy borrower.

Till the late 90s, the FICO score was the de facto tool for assessing credit-worthiness. It was used to both grant loans and even set the rate of a loan. But with the wild fluctuations in the stock market in the 2000s (the tech market crash as well as the housing crisis), the FICO score is turning out to be less accurate as a predictor (because even potentially reliable borrowers have weak credit as seen through the FICO lens) and there is now a growing market in predictive models for credit-worthiness that take advantage of all the data out there to be mined.

To formalize the predictive scenario as before, we assume that the model is presented with an individual $p$ and the goal is to output a score $s(p)$ that will indicate credit-worthiness. The lender might then use the score $s(p)$ and other information to generate an interest rate $r(p)$ for the individual, or a denial.

Features that are now often used (but not always) to determine whether and how much for a loan should be granted include:

* social media presence: a facebook feed that indicates risk taking behaviour might reduce the score for an individual.
* online reviews: if you're a small business and you're on Yelp, your reviews might be taken into account when decided how valuable your business is.

What is perhaps more interesting is that there are now proposals to use extended social networks to model an individual's credit worthiness. For example, the Chinese government is planning to compute a "citizen score" that will be used for a number of government services including loans and jobs. Their proposal is to use not just individual information but information about one's circle of friends (as captured by social media) to determine one's "value", with the full intention to use (for example) statements critical of the government â€” even by one's friends â€” as part of this computation.

### Training data

Training data for loan granting can come from a bank's prior customers. It is less clear how to build models for training from social media: one possibility is that the model builder tracks the social media presence of successful borrowers, and also obtains (via data brokers) information about rejected borrowers. There is a flourishing market in third party data scraped from various sources, involving large brokers like Axiom and others.

# Definitions of Fairness

At the heart of discussions of bias is the corresponding question of fairness and nondiscrimination. What does it mean for an algorithm to be "fair" or "unfair"? It turns out that this question will not lend itself to an easy answer, and will force us to return to the underlying philosophical and ethical questions around the idea of a just society. But in the meantime we can review the different definitions of fairness that different researchers have either proposed or have modeled based on inspiration from the real world.

In this discussion, we will only talk about the definitions themselves. We will defer discussions of mitigation (how to make sure biased patterns are not found) to a later lecture.

## Bias based on learning rules

The first notion of bias in data mining is due to Pedreschi, Ruggieri and Turini, and originates from the area of itemset mining. In this setting, the data is represented as a relation with attributes $a_i$. A transaction can be thought of as a row in this table. An *itemset* is a collection of attribute settings: for example, "pin code - 560 076", "state = KN", and so on. The support of an itemset $X$ is the fraction of transactions that satisfy it.

Consider a classification rule $X \implies Y$ learned by a data mining system on a table. We can quantify our *confidence* in this rule by measuring a proxy for the empirical probability $\Pr(Y \mid X)$: specifically,

$$ \text{conf}(X \implies Y) = \frac{\text{support(X,Y)}}{\text{support(X)}} $$

### Encoding beliefs about bias

As we shall see, all attempts to determine bias in ML must have some external statement about what kinds of decisions might be considered biased: this is not something the modeling process will discover by itself. In the case of association rule mining, this information is encoded by marking certain itemsets $X$ as *potentially discriminatory* (PD). For example, any rule of the form "If female, do something" has the itemset "gender = Female" as an antecedent and might be discriminatory in certain contexts. So we will assume *a priori* that a set of such PD itemsets is provided to us.

How do we measure bias then? The idea is to determine whether the PD itemsets made a *material difference* in the confidence of the learned association rule. Specifically, let the *extended lift* of a rule $A, B \implies C$ with respect to $B$ be the quantity

$$ \text{elift} = \frac{\text{conf}(A, B, \implies C)}{\text{conf}(A \implies C)}$$

Then they define a PD itemset $B$ as $\alpha$-discriminatory if $\text{elift} \ge \alpha$.

Note that if the attribute $C$ is binary, then the implications $A \implies C$ and $A \implies !C$ are related, and a stronger notion of the extended lift can be defined in that setting.

## Bias based on statistical discrepancy

At its core, the definition of bias is based on the idea of influence: how much does a particular variable appear to affect a decision? The next definition is more explicit, focusing directly on the outcome.

Assume again that we have a data set with attributes $a_i$. Suppose the goal of the decision-making process is to determine some outcome encoded as $C$ where $C =1$ is the positive outcome. We will encode beliefs about bias by specifying a particular itemset of the form $a_i = v$. For example "gender = FEMALE" or "race = non-white". The key to this notion of bias measurement is to look at the (conditional) difference in the favorable outcome for the selected group (as encoded by the itemset). The conditional probability of the good outcome for the subgroup is given by

$$ \frac{\Pr( C = 1 \mid X)}{\Pr(X)} $$

Similarly, the conditional probability for the rest can be written as

$$ \frac{\Pr( C = 1 \mid \overline{X})}{\Pr(\overline{X})} $$

Then one measure of statistical bias is the  difference between these numbers.

### Disparate Impact

The above measure of bias is used in the United Kingdom to quantify gender-based discrimination. In the US, we instead take the *ratio* of the two numbers. This is the basis of the "80% rule" that says that the ratio of the two conditional probabilities must not be less than 4/5.

In both cases, the discriminatory attribute is fixed ahead of time. In the US for example, attributes like race, gender, ethnicity, and age are subject to such scrutiny. For age (which is a continuous variable), the binary variant is whether the age is less than or more than 40.

### Equalizing odds

One argument against bias measurements based on statistical discrepancy is that it may be that in the population at large, there is a natural and "unbiased" difference in skills based on the protected attribute $X$. For example, if the job involves lifting of heavy objects, then an employer might argue that the average male is better suited to the task than the average female by virtue of having better upper body strength, and so this discrepancy will naturally appear in the hiring ratios without being discriminatory.

One way to address this issue is to require not that the different groups be treated equally, but that the decision procedure is equally accurate (or inaccurate) on the two groups. Thus far we have assumed a decision variable $C$ and the group attribute $X$. Let us now introduce the ground truth variable $C^*$. In other words, if $p$ is an individual, then $C(p)$ is the decision made by an algorithm and $C^*(p)$ is the decision it should have made.

The false positive rate for the predictor is $FP = \Pr(C = 1 \mid C^* = 0)$. Similarly the true positive rate is $TP = \Pr(C = 1 \mid C^* = 1)$. Suppose we evaluate $FP$ and $TP$ conditioned by group membership. Then we want that these numbers are the same for the two groups.

Another way to address the issue of equalizing odds is to instead try to equalize the probability of misclassification conditioned by group. In other words,

$$ \Pr(C \ne C^* \mid X = 1) = \Pr(C \ne C^* \mid X = 0)$$

## Fairness through Awareness

In all of the above, we're really considering the problem of nondiscrimination: how to make sure that different groups are treated fairly, for differing definitions of fair. But we can also take a very different perspective on the problem of fairness. Rather than ensuring that groups are treated similarly, we attempt to ensure that *individuals* are treated fairly.

Specifically, assume that for a given task, we have some sense of how close individuals are with respect to competency for that task For example this could be encoded as some kind of distance function $d(p, p')$. Further, assume that the outcome is the result of a randomized procedure, so that over repeated trials of the algorithm we can talk about the probability of the outcome $C = 1$ and more generally associate a rule with a distribution over outcomes for each individual. Then the idea of *individual fairness* says that two individuals who are close should be treated similarly. Formally, suppose we have some measure of distance between distributions $D$. Then

$$ d(x,y) \le \epsilon \implies D(C(x), C(y)) \le \delta$$.

Notice that this is a fundamentally different notion from group fairness. Indeed it is easy to design scenarios where one of these notions is satisfied but not the other, and so on.

## Fairness in Sequential learning

Thus far, we've considered fairness in the supervised (and batch) model of learning. There's a classifier, training data, test data and so on. But automated decision-making is an ongoing process, where the model might keep adapting to the data and making new decisions. While there's a whole issue of consistency in decision-making that we will not address, there's a more basic question of what fairness means in such a context.

One of the standard settings for thinking about sequential learning is the bandit model. While I won't go into details about the bandit framework in learning, I'll set up some basic notation.

Assume the bandit has $k$ arms. At each step $t$ the algorithm chooses one arm $i_t$ from a distribution $\pi^t$ over $[k]$ and receives the (stochastic) reward drawn $r_j$ drawn from an **unknown** distribution $\mathcal{D}_j$ with mean $\mu_j$. It then updates $\pi^t$ to get $\pi^{t+1}$ and the process repeats. The *regret* of the algorithm is the difference between its expected reward and the best expected reward. Since the best expected reward is obtained by always choosing the arm $i^*$  with the largest expected reward $\mu_{i^*}$, we can write the regret as

$$ T \cdot \mu_{i^*} - E \sum \mu_{i^t} $$

Let us denote the *history* of the process $h^t$ as the sequence of decisions made by the algorithm till time $t$. This includes all choices of arms to pull and all rewards obtained. At time $t$, we can now define the quantity $\pi_{j \mid h^t}$ as the probability that the algorithm chooses arm $j$ at time $t$ given the entire history $h^t$.

We're now ready to define a notion of fairness for sequential learning. Intuitively, the definition attempts to capture the idea that if the baseline value of one arm is more than another, the algorithm should choose it. Formally, an algorithm is $\delta$-fair if for all distributions $\mathcal{D}_1, \ldots, \mathcal{D}_k$, with probability at least $1-\delta$ over the history, for all $t$ and all arms $j, j' \in [k],

$$ \pi^t_{j\mid h} > \pi^t_{j' \mid h} \text{only if  } \mu_j > \mu_{j'} $$

The intuition behind this definition is this: the only justification for choosing one arm over another should be if there's a measurable benefit to taking that arm. If we (for example) think of arms as individuals, then we are trying to capture the idea a la individual fairness that the only justifiable reason for different treatment is different underlying quality (this is the contrapositive of the way individual fairness is framed).
